        <p> <strong>Justine</strong> is a no-nonsense bully that SAYS IT HOW IT IS. She likes to steal candy from small people and throw it on the ground in disgust.
        She thinks roaches are cute and keeps a couple under her pillow for good luck. Also for a mid-night snack if she's feeling peckish.

      <h2>Jonathan</h2>
      <img src="images/img_me.jpg" alt="Jonathan">
      <p><strong>Jonathan</strong> is a stand up guy that helps puppies out of wells and donates all of his time to the needy. Just because he himself is the needy is besides the point. 
      He puts his SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR JACKET over puddles so Justine doesn't have to ruin her endangered penguin-skin shoes. When Jonathan isn't giving life advice to the
      indigenous people of Papua New Guinea, he's talking to blind kids about how beautiful the world is and how they're really missing out.</p>
